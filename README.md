# CoffeeDox #

This is a port of the Dox module to CoffeeScript.

All code is as close to a direct port of Dox as I could pull off.  

All credit goes to visionmedia (TJ Holowaychuk) for the general 
ideas and logic.

Please see https://github.com/visionmedia/dox for the original .js parser.  This
module only parses .coffee files.

WARNING: This is a work in progress, a hobby project, and is probably broken.
I'd love help finishing and debugging it :)

Enjoy!
